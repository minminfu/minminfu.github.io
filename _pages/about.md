Welcome to my website! I recently started as a Flint Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University, working with Alexey Fedorov. Previously, I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University, where I was advised by Eli Tziperman. 

My research interests include the El Niño Southern Oscillation and dynamics of Westerly Wind Bursts (WWBs), a form of tropical wind variability of importance to developing El Niño events. Another current research interest is on past warm climates such as the Pliocene (the most recent epoch in Earth’s history of prolonged global warmth). Observations serve as the ultimate benchmark for climate models; paleoclimate therefore presents a unique opportunity for model validation, with the ultimate goal of more robust predictions of future change. More generally, I have become particularly interested in the hydrological cycle of near and deep-past paleoclimates, and I have also started to work on stochastic modeling and the role of silicate weathering in driving long-term climate change.
