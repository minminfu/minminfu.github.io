Welcome to my website! I am a climate dynamicist interested in a variety of topics spanning paleoclimate and climate change. Currently I am a Flint Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University, where I work with [Prof. Alexey Fedorov](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/alexey-fedorov/about). I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University in 2022, where I worked with [Prof. Eli Tziperman](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/). 

My research interests include the El Niño Southern Oscillation and dynamics of Westerly Wind Bursts (WWBs), a form of tropical wind variability of important to developing El Niño events. Other current research interests include paleoclimate, such as the warm Pliocene (the most recent epoch in Earth’s history of prolonged global warmth) and the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka). Another active branch of my research concerns the response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to ongoing climate change, where uncertainty persists regarding whether the mean state of Pacific sea surface temperatures will evolve to more closely resemble El Niño or La Niña in the coming decades, with implications for regional climate worldwide. I also have a strong interest in aspects of deep time paleoclimate and have worked on idealized studies of Earth’s climate in the distant past.
