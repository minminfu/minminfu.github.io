Welcome to my website! I am a climate dynamicist interested in a variety of topics spanning paleoclimate and climate change. I am a Lecturer of Climate Science at the University of Southampton now May of 2025. Please click [here for openings](https://minminfu.github.io/openings/) for Ph.D. study and postdoctoral work.

Previously, I was a Flint Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University, where I worked with [Prof. Alexey Fedorov](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/alexey-fedorov/about). I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University in 2022, where I worked with [Prof. Eli Tziperman](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/). 

My research interests include the El Niño Southern Oscillation, cliamte dynamics, climate change, and paleoclimate. Recent work has focused onthe warm Pliocene (the most recent epoch in Earth’s history of prolonged global warmth) and the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka). Another active branch of my research concerns the response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to ongoing climate change, where uncertainty persists regarding whether the mean state of Pacific sea surface temperatures will evolve to more closely resemble El Niño or La Niña in the coming decades, with implications for regional climate worldwide. I also have a strong interest in aspects of deep time paleoclimate and have worked on idealized studies of Earth’s climate in the distant past.
