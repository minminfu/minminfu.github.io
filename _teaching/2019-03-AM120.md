### Fall 2017, Fall 2018, and Fall 2019
As a teaching fellow, I helped students learn upper-division linear algebra concepts and the fundamentals of machine learning. 
For my work as a TF of APMTH120, I received the Harvard University Certificate of Distinction in Teaching from the Bok Center in 2019.
